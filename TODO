# Here are the things I want to add to this script-monkey piece of code

+ README
+ auto completion
+ backup-only function
+ netinstaller/updater (curl needed)
+ config file to make the script configurable without editing it
+ maybe autocofig
+ separate scripts to call functions from main flash script
+ make this dumb piece of crap smarter (initially it was 2-3 line dumb as hell script to avoid writing whole path names in dd, lol) 
+ make it buying you beer
+ ...anything that comes to my mind, but now it is enough things to do
